# Getting started

## Prerequisites

To start using Sherlock, you will need:

* an active [SUNet ID][url_sunet],

    !!! info "What is a SUNet ID?"

        A SUNet ID is a unique 3-8 character account name that identifies you
        as a member of the Stanford community, with access to the Stanford
        University Network of computing resources and services. Not to be
        confused with University ID (a 8-digit number that appears on your
        Stanford ID Card), your SUNet ID is a permanent and visible part of your
        Stanford identity and often appears in your Stanford email address (eg.
        sunetid@stanford.edu).

        SUNet IDs are not managed by Research Computing. For more information,
        see https://accounts.stanford.edu/


    !!! tip "SUNet ID [service levels][url_level] and external collaborators"

        Base-level service is sufficient for Sherlock accounts. External
        collaborators, or users without a SUNet ID, can be sponsored by a PI a
        get a sponsored SUNet ID at no cost. Please see the [sponsorship
        page][url_sponsor] for more information.

* a [Sherlock account][url_request],
* a [SSH client][url_ssh],
* good understanding of the [concepts][url_concepts] and [terms][url_glossary]
  used throughout that documentation,
* some familiarity with [Unix/Linux command-line environments][url_unix], and
  notions of [shell scripting][url_bash].



## How to request an account

To request an account, the sponsoring Stanford faculty member should email
{{ support_email }}, specifying the names and SUNet IDs of
his/her research team members needing an account.

Sherlock is open to the Stanford community as a computing resource to support
departmental or sponsored research, thus a faculty member's explicit consent is
required for account requests.

!!! danger "Sherlock is a resource for research"

    Sherlock is a resource to help and support research, and is not suitable
    for course work, class assignments or general-use training sessions.

There is no fee associated with using Sherlock, and no limit in the amount of
accounts each faculty member can request. We will periodically ensure that all
accounts associated with each PI are still active, and reserve the right to
close any Sherlock account whose SUNet ID is expired.



## SSH clients


### Linux :fontawesome-brands-linux:

Linux distributions usually come with a version of the [OpenSSH][url_openssh]
client already installed. So no additional software installation is required.
If not, please refer to your distribution's documentation to install it.

### MacOS :fontawesome-brands-apple:

MacOS systems usually come with a version of the [OpenSSH][url_openssh] client
already installed. So no additional software installation is required


### Windows :fontawesome-brands-windows:

Microsoft Windows doesn't provide any SSH client by default. To install one,
you have several options, depending on the version of Windows.

* **WSL <small>recommended</small>**

    Windows 10 provides a feature called the ["Windows
    Subsystem for Linux"][url_wsl] (WSL). Please refer to the [official
    documentation][url_wsl_doc] or [this howto][url_wsl_howto] for installation
    instructions. Once installed, you'll be able to use the `ssh` command from a
    Windows terminal to connect to Sherlock.

* Cygwin

    The [Cygwin project][url_cygwin] predates WSL and provides similar features,
    which among other things, allow users to install a command-line SSH client on
    their Windows machines.

The two options above will ensure the best compatibility with the Sherlock
environment. If you'd like to explore other avenues, many [other SSH client
implementations][url_ssh_clients] are available, but have not necessarily been tested
with Sherlock, so your mileage may vary.


## Unix/Linux resources

A full tutorial on using Unix/Linux is beyond the scope of this documentation.
However, there are many tutorials for beginning to use Unix/Linux on the web.

A few tutorials we recommend are:

* [Unix Tutorial for Beginners][url_tuto_1] (University of Surrey, UK)
* [Introduction to Unix][url_tuto_2] (Imperial College, London)
* [The Unix Shell][url_tuto_3] (Software Carpentry)

More specifically about HPC and Research Computing:

* [Intro to HPC][url_tuto_5] (HPC Carpentry)
* [HPC in a day][url_tuto_4] (Software Carpentry}
* [Research Computing Q&A][url_tuto_6] (Ask.Cyberinfrastructure)

### Text editors

Multiple text editors are available on Sherlock. For beginners, we recommend
the use of `nano`. And for more advanced uses, you'll also find below some
resources about using `vim`

* [Nano guide][url_nano] (Gentoo wiki)
* [Vim guide][url_vim] (Gentoo wiki)

Note: you can also create/edit files with the [Sherlock OnDemand File
editor][url_ood_files]


### Shell scripting

Compute jobs launched on Sherlock are most often initialized by user-written
shell scripts. Beyond that, many common operations can be simplified and
automated using shell scripts.

For an introduction to shell scripting, you can refer to:

* [Bash Programming - Introduction HOWTO][url_scripting]
