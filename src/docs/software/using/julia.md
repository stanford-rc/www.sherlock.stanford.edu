## Introduction

[Julia][url_julia] is a high-level general-purpose dynamic programming language that was
originally designed to address the needs of high-performance numerical analysis and 
computational science, without the typical need of separate compilation to be fast, 
also usable for client and server web use, low-level systems programming or as a 
specification language. Julia aims to create an unprecedented combination of 
ease-of-use, power, and efficiency in a single language.

### More documentation

The following documentation specifically intended for using Julia on Sherlock.
For more complete documentation about Julia in general, please see the [Julia
documentation][url_julia_docs].

## Julia on Sherlock

Julia is available on Sherlock and the corresponding [module][url_modules] can be
loaded with:

```
$ ml julia
```

For a list of available versions, you can execute `ml spider julia` at the Sherlock
prompt, or refer to the [Software list page][url_software_list].


### Using Julia
Once your environment is configured (_ie._ when the `julia` module is loaded), julia
can be started by simply typing julia at the shell prompt:

```
$ julia

For a listing of command line options:

```
$ julia --help

julia [switches] -- [programfile] [args...]
 -v, --version             Display version information
 -h, --help                Print this message

 -J, --sysimage <file>     Start up with the given system image file
 -H, --home <dir>          Set location of `julia` executable
 --startup-file={yes|no}   Load `~/.julia/config/startup.jl`
 --handle-signals={yes|no} Enable or disable Julia's default signal handlers
 --sysimage-native-code={yes|no}
                           Use native code from system image if available
 --compiled-modules={yes|no}
                           Enable or disable incremental precompilation of modules

 -E, --print <expr>        Evaluate <expr> and display the result
 -L, --load <file>         Load <file> immediately on all processors

 -p, --procs {N|auto}      Integer value N launches N additional local worker processes
                           "auto" launches as many workers as the number 
                           of local CPU threads (logical cores)
 --machine-file <file>     Run processes on hosts listed in <file>

 -i                        Interactive mode; REPL runs and isinteractive() is true
 -q, --quiet               Quiet startup: no banner, suppress REPL warnings

```
#### Running a Julia script

A Julia program is easy to run on the command line outside of its interactive mode. 

Here is an example where we create a simple [Hello World][url_helloworld] program and launch it with Julia

```
$ echo 'println("hello world")' > helloworld.jl
```

| Method | Output |
| ------ | ------ |
| `julia helloworld.jl`| `hello world` is displayed on `stdout`|
| `julia < helloworld.jl` | `hello world` is displayed on screen, on `stdout` |

#### Submitting a Julia job

Here's an example Julia sbatch script that can be submitted via `sbatch`.

```bash tab="juliaTest.sbatch"
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --mem=4G
#SBATCH --output=juliaTest.log

# load the module
ml julia

# run the Julia application
srun julia helloworld.jl
```

You can save this script as `juliaTest.sbatch` and submit it to the scheduler with:
```
$ sbatch juliaTest.sbatch
```

Once the job is done, you should get a `juliaTest.log` file in the current
directory, with the following contents:

```
$ cat juliaTest.log 
hello world
```


### Julia packages

Installing packages with Julia is very simple. Julia includes a package module in its base installation that handles installing, updating, and removing packages.

First import the `Pkg` module: 
```
julia> import Pkg

julia> Pkg.status()
    Status `~/.julia/environments/v1.0/Project.toml`
```

!!! tip "Julia packages only need to be installed once"

    You only need to install Julia packages once on Sherlock. Since fielsystems
    are shared, packages installed on one node will immediately be available on
    all nodes on the cluster.

#### Installing packages

You can first check the status of packages installed on Julia using the status function of the `Pkg` module:
```
julia> Pkg.status()
No packages installed.
```

You can then add packages using the add function of the `Pkg` module:
```
julia> Pkg.add("Distributions")
INFO: Cloning cache of Distributions from git://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl.git
INFO: Cloning cache of NumericExtensions from git://github.com/lindahua/NumericExtensions.jl.git
INFO: Cloning cache of Stats from git://github.com/JuliaStats/Stats.jl.git
INFO: Installing Distributions v0.2.7
INFO: Installing NumericExtensions v0.2.17
INFO: Installing Stats v0.2.6
INFO: REQUIRE updated.
```

Using the status function again, you can see that the package and its dependencies have been installed:
```
julia> Pkg.status()
Required packages:
 - Distributions                 0.2.7
Additional packages:
 - NumericExtensions             0.2.17
 - Stats                         0.2.6
```
#### Updating Packages

The update function of the `Pkg` module can update all packages installed:
```
julia> Pkg.update()
INFO: Updating METADATA...
INFO: Computing changes...
INFO: Upgrading Distributions: v0.2.8 => v0.2.10
INFO: Upgrading Stats: v0.2.7 => v0.2.8
```
#### Removing packages

The remove function of the `Pkg` module can remove any packages installed as well:
```
julia> Pkg.rm("Distributions")
INFO: Removing Distributions v0.2.7
INFO: Removing Stats v0.2.6
INFO: Removing NumericExtensions v0.2.17
INFO: REQUIRE updated.

julia> Pkg.status()
Required packages:
 - SHA                           0.3.2

julia> Pkg.rm("SHA")
INFO: Removing SHA v0.3.2
INFO: REQUIRE updated.

julia> Pkg.status()
No packages installed.
```
Working with packages in Julia is simple!

### Examples



Julia can natively spawn parallel workers across multiple compute nodes, without using MPI.

There are 2 modes of operation:

1. ClusterManager; in which you start Julia, and from within Julia, you
spawn workers which will actually submit jobs to the scheduler,
executing instructions within those jobs.

2. --machine file; here you submit a SLURM job and run the Julia
interpreter in parallel mode within the job's resources.

Mode 2 is easier to use, and more convenient, since you have all your
resources available and ready to use when the job starts. In mode 1,
you'll need to wait for jobs to be dispatched and executed inside Julia.

Here is a quick example on how to use the --machinefile mode on
Sherlock.

Given following Julia script (parallel\_test.jl) that will print a line
with the process id and the node it's executing on, in parallel:

    @everywhere println(@sprintf("process: %d on host %s", myid(), gethostname()))

You can submit the following job:

```bash tab="juliaTest.sbatch"
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --nodes 2
    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node 4
    #SBATCH --time 5:0

    ml load julia
    julia --machine-file <(srun hostname -s)  ./parallel_test.jl
```
Save as julia\_test.out.

Then:
```
$ sbatch  julia_test.sbatch
```
  
It will:

1. Request 2 nodes, 4 tasks per node (8 tasks total)

2. load the julia module

3. Run Julia in parallel with a machine file that is automatically
generated, listing the nodes that are assigned to your job.

It should output something like this in your slurm-(JOBID\#).out:
```
process: 1 on host sh-5-33.local
        From worker 3:  process: 3 on host sh-5-33.local
        From worker 5:  process: 5 on host sh-5-33.local
        From worker 6:  process: 6 on host sh-5-33.local
        From worker 4:  process: 4 on host sh-5-33.local
        From worker 2:  process: 2 on host sh-5-34.local
        From worker 7:  process: 7 on host sh-5-34.local
        From worker 9:  process: 9 on host sh-5-34.local
        From worker 8:  process: 8 on host sh-5-34.local
```
