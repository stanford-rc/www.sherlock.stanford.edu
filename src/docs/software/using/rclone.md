## Introduction

If you need to sync files between cloud storage to Sherlock,
[`rclone`][url_rclone] is a command line program that can help. You can easily
use it to transfer files from a cloud storage provider to Sherlock or Oak, or
vice versa. The following tutorial walks through transferring files between
Google Drive and Oak storage.

### More documentation

For more information on running `rclone`, please see the
[official documentation][url_rclone].

## Setup

### `rclone config`

Before transferring data for the first time, you will need to configure
`rclone` so that it can access your Google Drive. This will require use of your
browser, so you will need to connect to Sherlock with **local port forwarding**
(`ssh -L`). You only need to do this when you are configuring `rclone` for the
first time.

!!! Note "Use local terminal for `rclone config`"

    **This method will not work in the Sherlock OnDemand shell.** You will need
    to use your local machine's terminal to enable local port forwarding and to
    allow `rclone` to communicate with your browser. On Linux and macOS, you
    can use the Terminal app; on Windows, you can use the PowerShell app.

When running `rclone config` you will be prompted to enter names and values,
indicated by the `>` symbol. To leave it empty, press Enter.

```shell
# Connect to Sherlock with local port fowarding
$ ssh -L localhost:53682:localhost:53682 <SUNetID>@login.sherlock.stanford.edu


# Load the rclone module
$ ml system rclone


# Run the rclone configuration tool
$ rclone config

## Examples

### `rclone copy`

To transfer data between cloud storage and Sherlock or Oak, you can use the
`rclone copy` command.

``` shell
# Start an interactive dev session
$ sh_dev

# Load the rclone module
$ ml system rclone

# Copy a folder from Google Drive to Oak
$ rclone copy gdrive:<folder name> /oak/stanford/groups/<group_name>/<folder name>

$ Copy a single file from Oak to Google Drive
$ rclone copy /oak/stanford/groups/<group name>/<file name> gdrive:
```

### `rclone ls`/`lsd`

To view the files and folders in your cloud storage, you can use the `rclone
ls` and `rclone lsd` commands, respectively.

```shell
# Load the rclone module
$ ml system rclone

# List all top-level directories in Google Drive
$ rclone lsd gdrive: --max-depth 1

# List all files in a directory
$ rclone ls gdrive:<folder name>

# List all files on Google Drive (including those in folders)
$ rclone ls gdrive:
```
