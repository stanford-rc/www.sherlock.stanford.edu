!!! tip "Software installation requests"

    For more information about software installation requests, please see [the
    Software Overview page][url_sw_overview]

If the software package or version you need is not available in the [list of
provided software][url_sw_list], you may compile and install it yourself. The
recommended location for user-installed software is the
`$GROUP_HOME` [group shared directory][url_grp_home], which is snapshotted and
replicated off-site, and can easily be shared with members of a research group.
