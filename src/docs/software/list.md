# Software list

The full list of software centrally installed and managed on Sherlock is in the
tables below.

!!! todo "Work in progress"

    Software installations on Sherlock are an ever ongoing process. We're
    continuously adding new software to the list. If you're looking for
    something that is not in the list, please take a look
    [here][url_installations] for options.

Software modules on Sherlock are organized in *categories*, by scientific
field. It means that you will have to first load a category module before
getting access to individual modules.  The `math` and `devel` categories are
loaded by default. See the [Modules page][url_modules] for further details and
examples.


!!! warning "Licensed software"

    Access to software modules marked with ^<b class="lic"></b>^ in the tables
    below is restricted to properly licensed user groups.

    The SRCC is not funded to provide commercial software on Sherlock and
    researchers are responsible for the costs of purchasing and renewing
    commercial software licenses. For more information, please feel free to
    [contact us](mailto:srcc-support@stanford.edu) and see the [Stanford
    Software Licensing page](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/softwarelic) for
    purchasing information.

    In particular, more information about Matlab licensing on Sherlock is
    available on [SRCC website][url_matlab_sherlock] (login required).
