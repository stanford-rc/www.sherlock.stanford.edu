# About us

## SRCC

![logo](img/srcc.png){ align=right width=400 loading=lazy }

The Stanford Research Computing Center ([SRCC][url_srcc]) is a joint effort of
the [Dean of Research][url_dor] and [IT Services][url_uit] to build and support
a comprehensive program to advance computational research at Stanford.  That
includes offering and supporting traditional high performance computing (HPC)
systems, as well as systems for high throughput and data-intensive computing.

The SRCC also helps researchers transition their analyses and models from the
desktop to more capable and plentiful resources, providing the opportunity to
explore their data and answer research questions at a scale typically not
possible on desktops or departmental servers. Partnering with national
initiatives like NSF [XSEDE][url_xsede] program as well as vendors, the SRCC
offers training and learning opportunities around HPC tools and technologies.

## Why the Sherlock name?

If you're curious about where the *Sherlock* name came from, we always
considered that computing resources in general and HPC clusters in particular
should be the catalyst of innovation, be ahead of their time, and spur new
discoveries.

And what better account of what's happening on a high-performance computing
cluster than Benedict Cumberbatch [describing][url_quote] his role as Sherlock
Holmes in the BBC's modern adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's classic?

!!! quote "Benedict Cumberbatch, about Sherlock"

    _There's a great charge you get from playing him, because of the volume of
    words in your head and the speed of thought â€“ you really have to make your
    connections incredibly fast. He is one step ahead of the audience, and of
    anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his
    leaps are taking him._

Yes, exactly. That's Sherlock.


## Sherlock, of HBO fame

And finally, we couldn't resist to the pleasure of citing the most
prestigious accomplishment of Sherlock to date: a mention in [HBO's Silicon
Valley][url_sv] [Season 4 finale][url_ep38]!

Yep, you got that right, [Richard Hendricks][url_richard] wanted to use our
very own Sherlock!

Kudos to the show's crew and a big thank you to [HBO Data compression
stars][url_ieee], Professor [Tsachy Weissman][url_tsachy] and Dmitri Pavlichin,
for this incredible Sherlock shout-out. This has been an everlasting source of
pride and amazement for the whole SRCC team! :heart:{ .pulsate }
